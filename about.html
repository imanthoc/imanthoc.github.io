                    My first touch into the computer world was when I was probably 12 years old
                    when my uncle showed me how to make a simple html website. <br /> <br />
                    Since then (about 12 years now..) 
                    I have been learning and creating stuff that I find fascinating, 
                    these days I like the more low level stuff: 
                    bare metal programming, cpu architecture,
                    emulators, game development on classic systems and computers
                    and anything else I find interesting. <br /><br />
                    Obviously I studied Computer Science, although in retrospect 
                    Electrical & Computer Engineering would be a better choice.
                    To complement the stuff I didn't learn during my bachelor's I am now doing
                    an MSC in electronics.
